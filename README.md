* The purpose of this repository is to highlight how to deploy a Singularity and Spack together.
* At this moment, the workflow is expected to fail as we have not found a good solution to deploying the images (yet).

## Installing the container on Bridges 2
COMMENT: **Do not deploy on any system.**

Copy the

* `SIF` file
* and the Perl scripts

to `/opt/packages/flac/1.3.3`.

Copy the file `modulefile.lua` to `/opt/modulefiles/flac` as `1.3.3.lua`.

## Building the image using the recipe
### To build the image locally
Run the script `build.sh` to build image locally.

```
bash ./build.sh
```

### To build the image remotely
Run the script `rbuild.sh` to build image locally.

```
bash ./rbuild.sh
```
